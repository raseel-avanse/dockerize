# Dockerize
> Install docker quickly on Linux distributions

A simple boilerplate code to get started on developing bash script applications, which accept arguments similar to most Linux command-line applications.

## Getting started
Fork the project and try it with :
```
./basher.sh --help
```

## Usage
A VERSION file in the same directory as the basher script is used for maintaining the application script version information

## ToDo
* Add support for other Linux Distributions
